## oracle_fusion_context change

As I'll soon be starting a new role as an Oracle Fusion Payroll Consultant, I wanted to practice some of the required skills, especially in relation to Oracle's Fast Formula programming language. In this mini-project I'll be learning how to use the CHANGE_CONTEXTS functions in Fast Formula in order to change the context values within a formula block.
